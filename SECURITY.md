## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a security vulnerability either with this project or with a project this project depends on, don't hesitate to send an email to me at jonas.huebotter@gmail.com.
Your report should contain a summary of your findings and instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.

Once you reported a security vulnerability I will attempt to get back to you as soon as possible.
In the case of a security vulnerability of a dependency please also report the vulnerability to the projects maintainer.
I will most likely not be able to immediately address vulnerabilities stemming from dependencies (unless they were introduced in a recent release).
