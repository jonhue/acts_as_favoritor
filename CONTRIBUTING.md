## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Contributing ideas and reporting bugs

We use GitHub issues as a ticket system. You should open an issue if

* you want to [report a bug](https://github.com/tony-lang/tree-sitter-tony/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=);
* you want to [suggest a feature](https://github.com/tony-lang/tree-sitter-tony/issues/new?assignees=&labels=discussion%2C+enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=); or
* you want to [make changes to the documentation](https://github.com/tony-lang/tree-sitter-tony/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation.md&title=) (that go beyond fixing a syntax error here or adding a paragraph there).

You should **not** open an issue if

* you want to report a security vulnerability. In that case please reference the [security policy](SECURITY.md); or
* you have a question. If you have a question use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead or send an email to jonas.huebotter@gmail.com.

When you open an issue we urge you to use the provided templates.

## Contributing code

We appreciate your interest in contributing code. We flag issues we seek help with with the `help wanted` label. Issues that are good for first-time contributors are flagged with the `good first issue` label.

If you want to contribute code for an issue that is not flagged with one of these labels, ask kindly in the relevant issue. We will most likely appreciate your help with these tickets as well. Bear in mind that in this case, working on the ticket might require a little more direct communication beforehand.

In case you have any questions on an issue you want to take over don't hesitate to tag an owner of this project in your question in the issue timeline.

If you want to contribute code on something that doesn't have a belonging issue yet, please [open an issue](#contributing-ideas-and-reporting-bugs) first.

### Writing and testing code

acts_as_favoritor uses RuboCop to enforce code style and detect semantic problems with your code.
RuboCop is run with every pull request you open (and subsequent commits you push). Please reference the [readme](README.md#development) and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for details on how to run RuboCop locally.

Furthermore, we strongly encourage you to write tests for every change you propose that affects actual code. Details on how tests are run can also be found in the [readme](README.md#testing).

### Submitting a pull request

Once you're happy with your changes, you are ready to submit your pull request.

Please keep your description short and succinct, but explain what changes you made and - if applicable - why you made those changes.
The more descriptive your summary is, the more likely it is for your changes to be merged quickly.
Don't forget to reference the issue this pull request addresses.

Don't be taken aback if your pull request is not merged immediately. Most pull requests take a couple of rounds of iteration until everyone is happy with all changes made.

Once your pull request got merged, we're absolutely delighted to welcome you as a contributor to acts_as_favoritor!
